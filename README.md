# Drupal **field__project__sidebar** module

## Description
This module was developed for the Earth Observing Laboratory's primary website.

It provides a right sidebar navigation element for each website section.

## NOTE: This module requires modifications to be made to the page.tpl.php file in order to function.  A sample file is included in the repo for reference, but (much) more work needs to be done for it to be easily integrated into a generic theme
